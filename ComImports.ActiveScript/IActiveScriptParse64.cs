    /// IActiveScriptParse interface. For interpreted scripting languages that have no
    /// independent authoring environment, such as VBScript, this provides an alternate
    /// mechanism (other than IPersist*) to get script code into the scripting engine, and
    /// to attach script fragments to various object events.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Before the scripting engine can be used, one of the following methods must be called
    /// : IPersist*::Load, IPersist*::InitNew, or IActiveScriptParse::InitNew. The semantics
    /// of this method are identical to IPersistStreamInit::InitNew, in that this method tells
    /// the scripting engine to initialize itself. Note that it is not valid to call both
    /// IPersist*::InitNew or IActiveScriptParse::InitNew and IPersist*::Load, nor is it valid
    /// to call IPersist*::InitNew, IActiveScriptParse::InitNew, or IPersist*::Load more
    /// than once.
